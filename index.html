      <h3>My Story</h3>
      <p>
        I grew up in northern Pakistan along the Afghan border & immigrated to Canada in my early teens. 
        I started my career as a <strong>software engineer graduating from UWaterloo</strong>, working on the infrastructure side along data, cloud & DevOps. 
        Over time, I realized <strong>I was drawn to the business side of things</strong>, which I view as the thing that ensures what we're building actually serves a purpose. 
        That's exactly what was missing from my original work as a software engineer where my perspective of the world was equal to looking through a keyhole — 
        building things at companies but having little idea how it connects to the world or has an impact or aligns with my life path (which I didn't know what that was either).
      </p>
    
      <p>
        I decided to step away and pursue that curiosity further. 
        <strong>Knowing nothing about business, I decided to build one completely by myself at the age of 22</strong>, 
        producing ergonomics products like laptop stands & gel sitting cushions for those of us who sit at a desk all day. 
        I managed to scale this into a <strong>profitable cash-flowing business</strong> that gave me freedoms of time & location I previously had no access to, 
        which I used to explore living in other parts of the world (Dubai).
      </p>
    
      <p>
        Not a tech business, I know. But 'business' doesn't discriminate. At the end of the day, it's just a 
        <strong>collection of skills that applies to any type of business</strong> — strategy, customer insight, product development, 
        market differentiation, customer psychology, financial management, personal accountability, delegation & self-growth.
      </p>
    
      <p>
        As I was figuring out my business & operations skills, I started working as a <strong>product manager in San Francisco</strong> 
        at an e-commerce holding company. I grew their portfolio of physical products & helped build an analytics dashboard on top to optimize & 
        automate things like inventory forecasting, dynamic pricing & advertising.
      </p>
    
      <p>
        Now? I have a <strong>renewed interest in the deeper layers of the tech stack</strong>, aka infra, and how it enables the development 
        & distribution of key technology like AI. There are challenges in this part of the stack that I want to help solve, 
        that I believe have a large impact on everyone.
      </p>
