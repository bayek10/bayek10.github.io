      <h3>My Story</h3>
      <p>
        I grew up in northern Pakistan along the Afghan border and immigrated to Canada in my early teens. 
        I started out as a <strong>software engineer from UWaterloo</strong>, focused on infrastructure — data pipelines, cloud, and DevOps. 
        Over time, I became drawn to <strong>the business side of things</strong>, which I view as the set of skills that ensures what we're building 
        actually serves a purpose.
      </p>
    
      <p>
        That's exactly what was missing from my original work as a software engineer, where my perspective of the world was akin to looking through 
        a keyhole—building things at companies but having little idea how it connects to the world, has an impact, or aligns with my life path 
        (which I didn’t know what that was at the time either).
      </p>
    
      <p>
        I decided to take a leap and pursue that curiosity further. 
        <strong>Knowing nothing about business, I built one completely by myself at the age of 22</strong>, 
        designing and manufacturing ergonomics products like laptop stands and gel sitting cushions for those of us who sit at a desk all day. 
        I scaled this into a <strong>profitable cash-flowing business</strong> that gave me personal freedoms of time and location I previously hadn’t imagined, 
        which I used to explore other parts of the world and other parts of myself that came with exposing myself to novelty.
      </p>
    
      <p>
        Not a tech startup, I know. But <strong>'business' doesn't discriminate</strong>. Whether I'm building with bits or atoms, business is just a collection of skills 
        to help me effect the changes I'd like to see in the world: strategy, customer insight, product development, market differentiation, 
        customer psychology, financial management, personal accountability, delegation, and self-growth.
      </p>
    
      <p>
        In fact, having worked in technology startups before, I view my success in building a bootstrapped profitable business as a much-needed 
        <strong>balancing skill</strong>.
      </p>
    
      <p>
        Putting those skills to the test, I started working as a <strong>product manager in San Francisco</strong> at an e-commerce holding company. 
        I grew a portfolio of physical products and helped build analytics/forecasting software to optimize and automate inventory forecasting, 
        dynamic pricing and advertising.
      </p>
    
      <p>
        Now? I’m drawn back to <strong>the deeper layers of the stack</strong>; the infrastructure that enables the development and distribution of key technology like AI. 
        If we are to see the world experience the benefits of AI, we will require powerful platforms that empower builders to insert intelligence into people's 
        lives quickly and cost-effectively.
      </p>
    
      <p>
        <em>
          <u>
            <span class="highlight">
              I can help build that vision. I'm exploring where I am best suited to contribute. If you'd like to discuss, please shoot me a message on 
              <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/samihassaan/">LinkedIn</a> or <a href="https://twitter.com/samisphere__">X</a>.

          </u>
        </em>
      </p>
    
      <p>
        In the meantime, I'm building software to <strong>solve a practical headache for my friend</strong> (who’d call it a migraine): transforming 1000s of pages of Italian luxury furniture 
        documents into instantly searchable data for my friend’s villa furnishing business, saving at least $5,000/month.
